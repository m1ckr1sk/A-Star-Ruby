#AStar Micro Services
##The Idea
The idea of the A* routing micro service is to have a set of services which send the routing service a job.  A job contains an ID, a start position, a target position and a map.  A job buffer will store these componenets until they are all ready and then forward them to the routing service.  The routing service will then post the resulting path to a display service.

##Design Goals
Below are a set of design goals for each of the services:
1. Each service should have a heartbeat
2. Each service should broadcast any configuration when asked
3. Each service should be configurable
4. Each service should be 'plumbing' agnostic, i.e. not tied to a particular framework such as rabbitmq
